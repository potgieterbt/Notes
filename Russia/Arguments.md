## Russia felt pressure because NATO expanded:
* NATO is a defensive treaty, they will not help a member if it provokes a war (This comes from the wording of Article 5: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all“, there is no explicit statement the if a member starts a war that they will or will not defend them. however there is precedent of NATO members starting conflicts: USA and UK in IRAQ, UK vs Argentina).
* Does this justify invading another country?
	* If Italy proposes a defensive alliance with Austria does that give France the right to invade Italy because they’ve be antagonistic before (WW1)?
## USA promised that NATO would not expand “One inch eastward”:
* This claim is the main justification that Putin uses for his annexation of Crimea in 2014.
* This claim comes from a meeting that happened  in 1990 between USSR president, Mikhail Gorbachev and Secretary of State of the USA, James Baker.
* James Baker said “not one inch eastward”. This statement was in the context of the reunification of Germany, the promise was that no non-German NATO forces would be put in east Germany during the withdrawal of USSR forces from east Germany (This promise was codified into the agreement with the both German sides as well as the USA, UK, USSR and France. [NATO Speech on German Reunification](https://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1990/s900517a_e.htm)).
	* “This will also be true of a united Germany in NATO. The very fact that we are ready not to deploy NATO troops beyond the territory of the Federal Republic gives the Soviet Union firm security guarantees. Moreover we could conceive of a transitional period during which a reduced number of Soviet forces could remain stationed in the present-day GDR. This will meet Soviet concerns about not changing the overall East-West strategic balance. Soviet politicians are wrong to claim that German membership of NATO will lead to instability. The opposite is true. Europe including the Soviet Union would gain stability. It would also gain a genuine partner in the West ready to cooperate.“
* In [Interview](rbth.com/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html) Mikhail Gorbachev said in response to question of “One of the key issues that has arisen in connection with the events in Ukraine is NATO expansion into the East. … Why didn’t you insist that the promises made to you be legally encoded?”.
	* The topic of “NATO expansion” was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a singe Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either. Another issue we brought up was discussed: making sure that NATO’s military structures would not advance and that additional armed forces from the alliance would not be deployed on the territory of the then-GDR after German reunification. Baker’s statement, mentioned in your question, was made in that context. 
## Russian annexation of Crimea is fine because the people voted to join Russia:
* When does this ever apply elsewhere
* Question of whether the elections were free and fair (Do you trust any other Russia elections?)
* 

## Russian annexation of Crimea is fine because it was part of the USSR before:
* Does that many any territory of a previous empire mean that the empire can invade said territory (If the UK has the ability should it invade India?)
* The USSR expanded while in an alliance with Germany, then Germany went to war with the USSR, the USSR with the help of western powers pushed back Germany while taking back and gaining new ground, they did not give back the land to the people but continued to occupy all the territory gained. Meanwhile the western countries gave back the land that they have defeated the Germans in.


* Russia did the same thing to Georgia as Ukraine, They run the same strategy.
