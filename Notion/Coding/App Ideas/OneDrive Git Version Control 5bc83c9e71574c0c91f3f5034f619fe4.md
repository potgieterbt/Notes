Permanent app that checks for changes of select files, saves the changes to a “commit”, user is able revert changes back to a previous “commit”.

Ideas:

- Save commit only after a “session”, i.e. ~1 hour of inactivity (save space).
- User can create “versions” (save space), commits are only kept between the last 2 versions.
- UI for merging commits together.
