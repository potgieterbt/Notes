Run a simulation of a whole US election cycle for the use of each individual person, not an overall state view.

Each person is assigned a probability bias to vote for a party, this is biased from previous years of voting of the population.

When running an election the bias is added to a random probability generator.

Use this for both midterm and primary elections.

Running the midterm election affects the primary elections.

Show the difference between what happens when everyone votes vs when the actual amount of people votes.

Have the ability to run campaigns like door knocking and have a percentage of people 'flip' because of it.

Show how if there are more of one party in the house and senate how it affects the ability to pass laws and ish.

Later on:

Add differences in voting based on other characteristics of each person i.e. race, income, years since immigrating (if applicable), etc.
