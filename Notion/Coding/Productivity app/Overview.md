App Goal:

- Analyze my phone and computer usage and other things I do in my day to track how productive I am and how I feel each day based on what I do because I can't track accurately from memory
- Android and desktop app that accesses usage data and take screenshots to see what I am viewing also tracks productivity(Need to find what metrics to use e.g. keystrokes per minute)
- Server to do ml on the data I collected from my devices that gives me an output to predict how productive I will be by what I have done
- Data that I have to input manually such as what I ate for lunch or who I hung out with and for how long

Track app usage like Samsung Digital Wellbeing.

Track what I was doing on the app such as see what genre video I watch on youtube.

Track productivity with keystrokes and activity.
