### Tuesday
I watched a [video on caffeine](https://youtu.be/SBaX0jEYsjU?si=GA4bn57mZxVSpQX9) it claims that the effects of caffeine are both negative and positive, the positive is that is helps you to focus on the thing in front of you, the negative is that it makes you do things slower i.e. you will make the same decision but slower. I think I should try to limit my caffeine a bit, maybe only one cup a day and only before 12h00.
