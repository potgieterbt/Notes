### What's a compliment that meant a lot to me?

### What are my thoughts on growing older?

### Wednesday 
I didn’t do much today, it is my day off. I woke up at 08h20 and stayed in bed watching YT for about 1 hour and then make some coffee. I helped Dad take stuff to the dump at about 11h15. I had lunch about 13h30.
I think I should maybe do some electrical stuff, more micro-controller programming and maybe some reverse engineering, this may just be a fad that I want to pursue but I will probably learn a lot along the way.
I read some more “What every programmer should know about memory”, I leaded more about how caches ensure data that is stored in the caches is available for all cores and threads, this is achieved by either always writing to the main memory when writing to the cache, however this is very slow. The other way is the label data in the MESI system (modified, exclusive, shared, invalid)
