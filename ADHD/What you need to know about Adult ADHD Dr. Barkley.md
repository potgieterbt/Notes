ADHD in adults has been recognized for many years, 1700s.
Not much was done until 1970s-2000s.

DSA-5 ADHD Criteria Inattention Symptoms (5/9 required for diagnosis):
- Fails to give close attention to details
- Difficulty sustaining attention
- Does not seem to listen
- Does not follow through on instructions
- Avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort
- Loses thing necessary for tasks
- Easily distracted
- Forgetful in daily activities

DSA-5 ADHD Criteria Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms (5/9 required for diagnosis):
- Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat
- Leaves seet in classroom inappropriately
- Runs about or climbs excessively
- Has difficulty playing quietly
- Is “on the go” or “driven by a motor”
- Talks excessively
- Blurts out answers before questions are completed
- Has difficulty awaiting turn
- Interrupts or intrudes on others

Symptoms must be developmentally inappropriate, 5 from either symptom list
Symptoms onset in childhood before age 16, unless acquired after neurological injury
Cross-setting occurrence of symptoms, must happen multiple settings, e.g. at home and at work or with money and driving.
Significant impairment, Must be adverse consequences.
Due to ADHD impairing self-awareness, needed to corroborate self-reports through others
Exclude other disorders, usually ruled out due to most other disorders not affecting attention dating back to childhood. Only ADHD is know to cause chronic attention problems through childhood.
Symptoms persisted for >6 months
No subtypes - just presentations.

Two dimensions of neuropsychological deficits are:
- Deficient motor inhibition (restless, hyperactive)
- Impaired verbal inhibition (excessive talking, interrupting)
- Impulsive cognition (difficulty suppressing task irrelevant thoughts, rapid decision making)
- Impulsive motivation (prefer immediate gratification, greater discounting of delayed consequences)
- Emotion dysregulation (impulsive affect; poor “top down" emotional self-regulation)
	- Different to mood disorders because:
		- Provocted
		- Impulsive
		- A little more extreme
		- Hard to get control of
		- Understandable
		- Situation specific
		- Typically pass relatively quickly
		- Not bizarre or extreme
- Restlessness decreases with age, becoming more internal, subjective by adulthood

Inattention (6 types of attention, not all impaired by ADHD):
- ADHD impairs with sustained attention or persistence towards goals/future in general.
- Executive attention (& functioning):
	- Poor persistence towards goals, tasks, the future (can’t sustain attention/action over time)
	- Destractible (impaired resistance to responding to goal-irrelevant external and internal events)
	- Deficient task re-engagement following disruptions, this is a Working-Memory Problem (skips across uncompleted tasks)
	- Impaired working memory (Lack the ability to hold onto the goal for very long, forgetful in daily activities, cannot remember what is to be done)
	- Diminished self-monitoring

The underlying problem is deficiencies in the brain’s executive functions which are mechanisms that permit self-regulation and cross-temporal organization of behavior toward the future

Types of self-directed actions that are often mental and modify automatic behaviour in order to alter later consequences:
- Self-awareness
- Inhibition or self-restraint
- Working memory (nonverbal and verbal)
- Emotional self-regulation
- Self-motivation
- Planning and problem-solving

Diagnostic Steps & Issues:
- Clinician will ask open-ended questions about what the patient is worried about and what brought them into the appointment.
- Ask how long the symptoms have existed.
- If sounds like symptoms are caused by ADHD, they will get the DSM-5 and go down the list of symptoms.
- Make sure the symptoms are deviant for age and sex: Will use a rating scale of how often the symptoms occur - allows clinician to determine how far off the norm the patient is.
- Review the DSM-5 symptoms for childhood/teens (6 or more of the 9 symptoms)
- Establish onset during childhood or teens
	- Was patient previously diagnosed as child or teen?
		- Females were often under-diagnosed until 2000s
		- Just 1 in 10 adults having ADHD ere previously diagnosed or treated for it, though 1 in 4 were treated for related condition.
- Establish pervasiveness of symptoms (affecting several settings)
- Establish domains of impairment and their onset:.
	- Impairment can be setting specific and may not arise in childhood or teen years due to informal accommodations being provided by family or school
	- High IQ cases can often go further in education with less effort than average IQ cases
- Evaluate for comorbidity - rate is very high (80+% of clinic cases)
- Corroborate patient reports through others and archives
- Rule out malingering, particularly among college students (Areas where ADHD gives them an advantage to have it)
	- Compare all sources of information and history for consistency
	- Refer to psychologist for symptom validity testing, as needed

Treatment components:
- Diagnosis (and evaluation of comorbidities)
- Education (learn about ADHD, Read widely and look for consistency across sources)
- Medication(s) - most effective treatment
- Modifications (changing behaviors and cognition)
- Accommodations (alteration of environments)
	- Workplace
	- Home
	- Educational settings
	- Choosing ADHD-friendly settings & occupations

Evidence-Based Treatments:
- Clinical viewpoint - The diabetes of Psychiatry
- Medications:
	- Stimulants: Methylphenidate, amphetamines
	- Non-stimulants: Atomoxetine
	- Alpha-2 Agonists: Clonidine XR, Guanfacine XR
- Counseling About the disorder:
	- Get educated about it
	- Then own it
- Environmental Accommodations:
	- Make changes to work and home settings to promote better performance
		- Organizing Workspace
		- Time-management tips
		- Using calendars and day planners and computers for scheduling and To-Do Lists
	- Utilize others for being accountable for promises and work
- CBT for Self-Control and Executive Function Deficits
	- Self-Restraint, Time management, Organization, Self-Motivation, Emotional self-regulation
- ADHD Coaching
- Learn Mindfulness and Meditation:
	- Especially for better emotional control and stress reduction
- Regular Exercise and Incorporate Movement During Sedentary Work or Activities
- Engage Preventive Medical and Dental Care

Possible Requirements ADHD friendly occupation:
- Any jobs that allow:
	- More movement during work
	- Less periods of sustained attention to boring tasks
	- More excitement, stimulation seeking, unpredictability
	- Frequent changes in workplace setting
	- More accountability to others (less independent work), team goals
	- Flexible hours (do better in afternoons and evening); less emphasis on time and deadlines
	- Less emphasis on organizing long-term projects
	- Frequent interaction with others
	- Smaller work quotas with frequent breaks
	- Plays to individuals’s aptitudes or strengths
	- Allows impulsive actions and emotional expression (performing arts, comedy)
	- Lateral creativity (high IQ adults) but less feasible and less follow through alone - so be part of a creativity team
