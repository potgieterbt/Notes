If ignoring everything else, the sharing of the Pxie videos with ANYONE without her consent is completely fucked.
His response to the lawsuit is not great but is understandable due to not wanting to incriminate himself.
The way that he handled the aftermath of the leaks:
* Seems like he wanted to protect Pxie, it could have been him trying to prevent the current situation.
* The advice to just ignore things and it will pass seem a bit out of touch to a normal person. Probably just him trying to help with “steamer” advice.
* The payment stuff seems like it could be genuine due to the chat with Erin.

Overall, He completely fucked up sharing explicit material in the first place, I don’t think it should be forgiven easily if at all.
His response could be genuine, if a little minimising. He could also just be abusive and manipulative and being smart about it(e.g. talking to Erin before hand makes it look more genuine, may still be manipulative but it makes it look better)

I’m not sure what sort of evidence would be possible to win back favour because it is private by it’s very nature so proving anything is almost impossible.
