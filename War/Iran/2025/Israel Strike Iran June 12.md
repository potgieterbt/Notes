IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that strike hit Natanz site but said IAEA monitoring and Iranian reports show no elevated radiation levels.

	* Abdol Hamid Minouchehr: Dean of the Shahid Beheshti University nuclear faculty.
	* Amir Hossein Feghhi: Head of the Nuclear Science and Technology Research Center, which operates under the AEOI.
### Iran Response:
* Iran conducted a two-wave ballistic missile attack about 18 hours after initial Israeli strikes. IDF says that Iran launched less that 100 missiles and the majority were intercepted that crossed into Israeli territory. At lease 7 missiles or Israeli interceptors impacted Tel Aviv. Israeli emergency services reported that attacks have injured at least 35 people.
* There is a lot of misinformation about the attack, such as people sharing videos of previous attacks on Israel. Iranian media is incentivised to exaggerate the success of the attack.
* Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Iran will respond with force and make Israel helpless. The Iranian Supreme National Security Council previously stated on June 9 that Iran would strike Israeli nuclear facilities in retaliation.
* The following is a brief description of each of the promoted individuals:
	* **Abdol Rahim Mousavi** is a career Artesh officer and was the overall Artesh commander before Khamenei appointed him as Armed Forces General Staff (AFGS) chief. His appointment marks the first time in the history of the Islamic Republic that an Artesh officer has held this position; Khamenei has usually selected IRGC officers for the post. Nevertheless, Mousavi is a sensible choice for two reasons. He has some experience managing and coordinating between the armed forces at this level, as he was the AFGS deputy chief from 2016 to 2017. Furthermore, Mousavi is deeply ideological, despite being an Artesh member, having declared repeatedly in recent years that he would have served in the IRGC’s paramilitary Basij if he were not already in the Artesh.[49] Khamenei has thus empowered a competent and deeply loyal officer to manage the Iranian armed forces. Khamenei previously entrusted Mousavi with managing the Iranian integrated air defense network in 2019, further highlighting the trust that Khamenei has in him.[50]
	* **Mohammad Pak** Pour was the commander of the IRGC Ground Forces before Khamenei appointed him to be the overall IRGC commander. Khamenei seems to have significant confidence in Pak Pour, 16 Copyright © Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project, 2025 given that Khamenei has kept him as the IRGC Ground Forces commander since 2009. During this time, Pak Pour oversaw the deployment of IRGC Ground Forces cadres to Syria to support the effort to keep Bashar al Assad in power.[51] These cadres reflected the growing Iranian focus on expeditionary operations and coalition warfare with the Axis of Resistance and Russia. Pak Pour also commanded the IRGC Ground Forces through intense periods of social unrest in Iran. The IRGC Ground Forces deployed in some cases to brutally suppress anti-regime demonstrations.[52] That Pak Pour kept his position through this unrest is even more remarkable when considering that Khamenei has replaced virtually every other major official responsible for internal security in recent years.
	* **Ali Shadmani** was the Khatam ol Anbia Central Headquarters coordination deputy before Khamenei appointed him to command the headquarters. Coordination deputies in Iran are roughly equivalent to a chief of staff in the US military. Shadmani spent his career commanding different units in the IRGC Ground Forces before going to the headquarters. CTP-ISW previously identified Shadmani as a rising figure in the military establishment, as influential military figures appeared to favor and empower him.

South Pars is one of the largest gas fields in the world and is central to Iran’s domestic energy supply. IDF reportedly targeted Fajr-e Jam Gas Refinery in Bushehr Province. The refinery processes gas from the South Pars field and Nar and Kangan fields and plays a key role in purifying Iran’s domestic natural gas supply. Over 90% of Iran’s electricity is generated by gas-powered thermal plants.
* Disruptions to Iran’s natural gas production will likely worsen the country’s ongoing energy crisis and lead to more widespread electricity blackouts. Iranians have previously protested against the regime in response to energy shortages.
