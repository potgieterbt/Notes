This is something I have been thinking about then regulating social media age restrictions. Is there a way that we can use the government having verifiable forms of ID on the population, can we use that in a way that:
1. We don’t need to trust more companies with sensitive documents and instead trust the government with the documents that they already have.
2. Limit what information the companies are able to access, e.g. only access age and name but not my birth sex.

There are some challenges with this model such as verifying that the person on the social media app is the same person that is on the government database. Solutions could be that you have to submit a document when verifying but the company does not have access to save the document. Another option is the the government handles the verification, similar the “Sign up with google”, where it will redirect you to the government website, put ID number of some sort with other verifications such as birth date, etc. and then person selects what data the companies can access (maybe have the link select what is needed), the user can then confirm and the data is given to the company. There are many issues with this because of the sensitive nature of the information the is being accessed. Maybe better if it is only a verification on age reduces the likelihood of extra information being leaked through this process.
