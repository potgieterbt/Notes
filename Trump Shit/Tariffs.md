Trade representative was not aware that tariffs were being paused on the day that they were paused.
Claims that there had been discussions, but was finding out about the details at the same time as everyone else. “I knew it was a possibility”
Trump Eco advisor claims that the reason that Russia was not included in the tariffs was because the US was negotiating with Russia and Ukraine.
Trump says the reason that there are no tariffs on Russia is because the US doesn’t do much trade with Russia.
