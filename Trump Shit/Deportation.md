Pam Bondie states that under Trump first term the courts found that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was part of MS13 gang and then after they just let him go?
Trump administration states that they have no power to bring Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador and that all that the Supreme Court stated was that they would have to provide a plane if it was needed.
In the press conference with the El Salvadorian president/dictator and Trump that El Salvadorian president said that he does not have the power to release Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.
	So who the fuck has the power to release him, fucking God?
In the same press conference on of the Trump cabinet ministers (Stephen Miller) stated that the ruling from the Supreme Court was 9-0 in their favour?!?!?!?
