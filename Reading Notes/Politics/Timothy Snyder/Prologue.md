The American founding fathers were concerned about the future of America and trying to keep it form going the same way as many other democracies and collapse.
“Aristotle warned that inequality brought instability, while Plato believed that demagogues exploited free speech to install themselves as tyrants”
In the face of concerns that our current system is threatened by tyranny we can do as the founding fathers did and contemplate the history of other democracies and republics.
The bad news is that history of modern democracies is one of decline and fall.
Since US independence from British there have been 4 major democratic moments: after WWI, after WWII and after the end of communism in 1989.
European democracies collapsed into far-right authoritarianism and fascism in the 1920s and '30s. Communist Soviet Union extended its model into Europe in 1940s.
Both fascism and communism were responses to globalisation: to the real and perceived inequalities it created and apparent helplessness of democracies in addressing them.
