# Nixon in Beijing

After the end of the WWII, growth in Asian countries increased greatly. These countries include Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. 
Many people in America started worry that they were falling behind in terms of global trade and growth, this is mostly due to Europe recovering from WWII, by rebuilding their factories which enabled them to start competing in global trade. The fear that the US was falling behind caused the US government to take more protectionist measures than it had up to this point(1970s). One of these measures was to take the US Dollar off the gold standard, which devalued the Dollar against other countries which gave an advantage to domestic production. Globalisation would eventually be highly beneficial to the US economy but in the beginning it caused people to feel that the US was falling behind.
Nixon: Detente, kept and expanded social programs, wanted to get out of Indochina wars and to do so he thought he would have to negotiate with the Soviets and China, wanted to relax tensions with china.
During the election campaign he pledged to restore American Greatness and often had an air of prejudice against American minorities and foreigners taking advantage of America. When Nixon was elected he knew that he would have to back off from some of the campaign promises. Domestically he kept many of the social reforms from the Johnson administration and even expanded some of them. Internationally, he wanted to reduce the cost to America while keeping its dominance, to achieve this he knew he would have to negotiate a temporary truce with the Soviets. Nixon also wanted to end the war in Vietnam, he thought that the way to do so was to negotiate with the Soviets and China. He wanted to reduce tensions with China.
Japan: 1951: there was a split between right and left, the right stopped its in-fighting and formed Lib-Dem Party(LDP), defeated the left and was in power for the next 35 years, the US at the time was more scared of the Japanese left than the right so helped Japan with its ability to export to the US, Europe and South-East Asia. 1960: US-Japan Treaty renewal caused protests from unions, students and government employees, the LDP then decided that it needed to be more inclusive and promised that peoples income would double in 10 years, they achieved it in 7.
