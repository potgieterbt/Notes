# Age Of Brezhnev
#History #Russia #ColdWar #Brezhnev

Brezhnev was a general in the Russian army in World War 2 and he did not want the Russian population to experience anything like it again.
When He came to power it lead to a time or relative peace through the 1960s-70s.

USA focused on Vietnam while ignoring other possible Soviet influence elsewhere and The Soviets did not seem interested in getting involved in Vietnam.
Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia and most western governments ignored it and while there were protests by the people in western countries there was little intention to do anything due to the USA not backing anything and most western governments focused on domestic issues such as welfare programes.

Student led political parties, failed.
## Second Half
### France:
* French president de Gaulle, did not like the bipolarity of the superpowers and once France had tested its first nuclear bomb in 1960 de Gaulle attempted to build bridges with the eastern countries while allying with the US. de Gaulle declared a conference on the 20th anniversary of the Yalta conference in 1965, to overcome Yalta and bring an end to the division of Europe. He also had meeting with the governments in Moscow, Warsaw and Bucharest. The US could disregard this because they saw NATO as being secure. US president Johnson did not want to withdraw troops from Europe, but also tried to get Europe and Japan to take on more responsibility for their own defence.
### Germany:
* Germany seemed to be fairly stable at this point, such that the Johnson administration believed that Germany was less of an immediate issue because West Germany was in NATO. The 1957 Treaty of Rome created the EEC which included – Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany – created a common market of goods, capital and workers. The EEC lead to the increased growth of the West German economy. In the 1965 elections the SPD(SocDems) won with Willy Brandt as the leader. Brandt lead West Germany to use the foreign policy of Ostpolitik with the help of the architect of the policy, Egon Bahr, which called for the building of relationships with both the east and the west with the end goal of German Reunification. Brandt knew that the road to East Germany lead through Moscow. Brandt promised Moscow increased trade and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and both sided agreed that the postwar borders of Europe including Polish-German and East and West German borders were inviolable. Following the Moscow Treaty, Brandt made a treaty with Poland in 1970 which accepted borders and promised cooperation. Brandt made the most progress with the Polish population in December 1970 by going to the memorial of the 1943 uprising against the German occupation of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto, Brandt placed a wreath and then sank to his knees in the snow. East Germany was worried about the effectiveness of Ostpolitik and refused to have talks with Brandt until he gave full diplomatic recognition of the GDR. But by 1972 the East German government accepted that it would have to negotiate with West Germany to avoid the displeasure of Moscow. In December 1972, a Basic Agreement, involving respecting each other’s jurisdiction and mutual independence in international affairs, but the real significance was that the two German states were dealing with each other directly.
### CSCE:
* In 1950s, the Soviets had put forward idea of an all-European security organisation which was rejected at the time, but in the 1960s European leadership had warmed to the idea. The CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) is the result and the condition that western Europe had was the the US would be included in the talks with regular NATO consultations. The surprise was the engagement of some of the eastern European countries that had shown to loyal to Moscow, such as Poland and Hungary. By the early 1970s the Soviets would have faced major backlash if they were to have halted the process, the Soviets had intended the talks to primarily have been for propaganda since the origin of the idea was to try and exclude the US in European talks. The CSCE proposed “Basket III” which involved human rights and freedom of speech, surprisingly the Soviets accepted Basket III, from internal discussions the leadership did not see the agreement as binding and that it “gives no one the possibility of intervening in internal affairs of another state”. Brezhnev told himself and others that the agreement was just language.
### Third-World:
* At the first meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1964, a group of 77 non-European countries promised to consult further on trade, at the first meeting in Algeria in 1967, issued the Algiers Charter which called for fairer prices for raw materials, acceptance of principles of political and legal sovereignty in global trade and more open and equitable world markets. The UN General Assembly in 1974 passed the New International Economic Order(NIEO) which called for the right of states to control the extraction of their natural resources through state-managed resource cartels, nicknamed “socialism among states”. After this in the 1970s became a decade of global economic and political roles changing dramatically.
