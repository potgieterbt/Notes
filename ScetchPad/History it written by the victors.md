Why don’t we hole other subject to the same standard?
* Physics are just theories are assumed true until proven false
* Physics theories are decided to be true by the people at the time.
* History can be questioned but it should be done in more of a scientific way, by providing proof or reasoning rather than just based on vibes(“History is written by the victors“).
* For some reason people think that history is something that can be tampered with more than other subjects.
* There is an underlying truth of history but our ability to see the truth is limited due to aging and destruction, but the same thing is kinda true for science, our ability to see the fundamental truth of the universe is limited to our own perception and imagination.
* Physics theory is put forward and at the time is not proven false so is added to the “correct” theories → in the future someone is able to prove the theory incorrect and someone is able to put forward a better theory that may be accepted by the scientific community.
* In the same way historians are able to put forward a view of history to counter other view of history and someone can always just prove a view wrong by providing evidence to counter the view without having a to put forward a view of history.
