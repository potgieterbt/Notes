maybe a python or go app:

Start app with Task Start. Temp tasks are active as long as pc is not restarted or until Task Stop is run
Simple app where if I type "Task" (maybe use -a to add) in cli creates a task with name of the rest of the cli arg
"Task" with out arg lists all tasks with index
Use -r to remove item by index
Can have permanent task list that writes to a file and a temp task list that runs while current session is active
