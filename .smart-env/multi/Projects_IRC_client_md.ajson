The IRC specs in RFC1459 and RFC2812 give some pretty useful hints here. My advice from experience is to split on \" :\" (space then colon) - this is the last parameter of the message, then split the first half by spaces. If the first entry in your list starts with a space, split it again by ! and @ to get the parts of the nickname/username/hostname tuple. Follow this method, and you'll have the base to a much more robust and extensible parser than one you could ever build using regular expressions.":[250,250]},"outlinks":[{"title":"Client Protocol","target":"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2812.txt.pdf","line":97},{"title":"PDF","target":"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc2812.txt.pdf","line":103}]},
