I was introduced to programming in the beginning of high school and has been a hobby of mine since then. All my learning has been self-motivated and based on my interests. 
I want to study computer science because it will give me a great foundation of knowledge to enable me to create better software. Video games have always been an important part of my life, some of my favorite childhood memories are late night gaming sessions. I want to help create that same experience for future generations, I hope to achieve this through developing console emulators to preserve many of the games that will otherwise be lost to time. In order to achieve this I need to have a strong foundation in low-level and hardware to develop performant and accurate emulators.
I studied computer science as one of my A-Levels which have me the opportunity develop a basic understanding of how computers work, this course will build on this knowledge of software and algorithms.
I have a strong foundation in the python programming language and have learned C through the Harvard CS50 course and have a basic understanding of the C++ programming language. I enjoy learning new things and what the best approach to a problem is.
I did work experience at Vodafone where I learnt a lot about the many fields that are available within software development.
Software of all types are essential to our lives already and I am excited about the future of software, I want to be a part of making that future possible 
I want to be a software engineer to be able to design and develop tools that make peoples lives easier. 



Develop tools that help people, Ensure that the programs I write are the best.
